**How to make a string grid in a Firemonkey desktop application "responsive" when using Livebindings**

Making the column widths of a Firemonkey string grid requires only a few lines of code, although the exact steps to achieve this are not well-documented as far as I was able to find. This is a demo of the programming needed to achieve "responsive" column widths in a FireMonkey desktop application that uses LiveBindings.

The code is straightforward, but not limiting. In the demo, the column widths are adjusted and minimim widths and maximum widths are applied. Additional kinds of adjustments can also be applied depending on the needs of the individual application and inventiveness of the developer.

There is an associated blog post. When ready, this Readme will be updated with a link to the blog post.
